torrego propose two type mark accusative one structural case inherent case mark accusative inherent causative agentive verb those affect object structural verb theoretical difference appeal order account asymmetry respect extraction mark accusative object extraction illform former class verb latter presence extra structure create inherent case marker crucial element explanation contrast chapter examine variation causative structure spanish argue variation largely condition case assignment much discussion base causative structure causee appear between causative verb hacer infinitive one goal chapter explain restriction fairepar causative several spanish dialect dialect fairepar causative fully acceptable follow situation object clitic present reflexive clitic present otherwise best verb identify constructive accomplishment build casemark object chapter analyze construction dative object both ditransitive verb unaccusative restriction regard construction two object identical casemark examine chapter deal contrast between presence absence double clitic comparison double object construction english analysis present contrast raise construction s eem between those without dative argument acceptable those unacceptable conclusion briefly summarize end critical discussion book mine linguistic puzzle concern object causative construction clitic relate phenomenon spanish interest anyone concern matter regardless analysis theoretical framework one wish adopt book interest linguist want minimalist program apply particular empirical domain author great job synthesize datum present generalization need explain despite positive aspect book experience serious frustration while read datum analysis data problem datum minor one compare one fact many datum present alien variety spanish speak familiar naturally cannot claim variety spanish surprise discover datum belong spanish example follow torrego present contrast pp between quiene le vieron quiene lo vieron both form equally illform clitic form parenthesis include example la guerra lo hizo subir page claim allow animate read clitic lo although allow inanimate read fact claim hold spanish dialect where preinfinitival causee hacer intransitive verb attest causative structure highly marginal example la maestra hizo lo alumno subir construction exemplify sentence hizo pedir yo analyze book alien main problem numerous discrepancy datum hard evaluate difference interpretation datum due difference datum obvious possible misanalysis actually same datum illustrate consider argument support claim structure embed under hacer sentence la guerra hizo subir lo precio single unit p torrego claim standard constituency test indicate sequence subir lo precio sentence constituent provide example follow support claim lo que la guerra hizo e subir lo precio war cause rise price d que ha hecho la guerra sino subir lo precio war cause except rise price translation sentence indicate gloss rather war raise price war raise price a d respectively tend believe torrego play polysemy hacer subir hacer either causative verb mean cause generic transitive verb translatable d o subir either intransitive equivalent rise transitive equivalent raise example relevant torrego s claim hacer must causative subir intransitive exemple acceptable even though perfect subir transtive verb whose unexpress subject coreferential la guerra under interpretation hacer function causative verb counterpart d o show conclusively variety spanish interpretation right instead subir verb intransitive unacceptable result caer fall verb even though sequence caer lo precio appear follow causative verb hacer la guerra hizo caer lo precio cannot appear focus topicalize constituent verb lo que la guerra hizo e caer lo precio war cause fall price b que ha hecho la guerra sino caer lo precio war cause except fall price conclude torrego s datum provide evidence claim sequence subir lo precio causative construction constituent those example include causative verb hacer course reach conclusion variety spanish familiar where ungrammatical example grammatical variety spanish analyze torrego case conclusion apply example constitute relevant evidence claim under investigation analysis second difficulty book analysis analysis provide trouble understand many analysis many case fail derive prediction follow analysis cannot tell constitute counterexample analysis cannot figure role assumption play analysis etc due deficiency part reader experience same difficulty next point problem case chapter book start list six generalization mark accusative pp mark accusative cooccur double clitic dialect necessary condition clitic double mark accusative object interpret specific telicity require mark accusative animate object subject clause mark accusative object agent cause mark accusative restrict animate affect animate object require mark accusative indication along generalization follow unify analysis main idea underlie analysis object mark accusative raise specifier position functional category v vp complement ideally overt movement operation kind testable effect word order property construction follow straightforwardly operation however torrego note visible effect object raise word order motivation analysis rest entirely explain generalization list above generalization explain attribute various property correlate overt casemark spec v vp position oneby one basis example propose spec v vp specific interpretation presence object spec v vp shift aspect predicate telic situation presence object spec v vp agentive interpretation subject etc one wonder why analysis preferable one attribute property directly overt casemark both case oneby one stipulation those property require clear advantage attribute property special phrase structure position weak evidence pp ff torrego claim two type mark accusative mark accusative nonaffect object structural case wherea mark acusative affect object inherent case however claim face major problem torrego note simply disregard inherent quirky case generally accept property preserve under passivization argument inherent case nt lose change case mark clause passivize genitive dative case icelandic example dative case spanish example case mark change active passive however mark accusative case affect object spanish preserve relevant example p torrego note contrast spanish hindus dialect preserve accusative ko mark passive cite mohanan torrego p mark accusative affect object inherent overt mark passivization preserve mark dative genitive preserve icelandic passive remains whether relevant datum dialect hindus confirm expectation relevant datum dialect hindus confirm expectation example mohanan mohanan show agree identify inherent case case mark preserve under passivization must conclude mark accusative case inherent dialect hindus case mark change under passivization structural dialect hindus where change under passivization force conclude structural spanish preserve under passivization ignore evidence still conclude mark accusative case inherent case spanish devoid distinction between structural case inherent case conceptual empirical substance standardly asociate torrego explicitly reject association agentivity effect clause mark accusative explain follow follow suggestion chomsky s causative agent role understand interpretation assign v vp configuration since mark accusative assign object raise spec vp presence mark accusative imply existence v vp configuration therefore whenever mark accusative must agentive causative interpretation happen verb allow alternation between mark unmark accusative object mean verb alternate between v vp configuration configuration second option spell consequence presence absence v vp configuration overt case mark corelation between overt case mark property agentivity pp ff torrego try relate idea mark accusative affect object lexical quirky case grimshaw s theory quirky case mark grimshaw s theory argument argument structure rank prominence two tier aspectual tier thematic tier adopt theory torrego propose p argument subject object lexically quirky mark thematic aspectual prominence relative argument unclear one interpret proposal prominence comparative property less prominent b prominence relative b either meaningless true pair argument

torrego conclude approach cover fact object agentive caustive verb must lexically quirky case mark cover fact overall phenomenon mark accusative case happen verb agentive subject fail prediction derive regard animacy restriction overtly case mark object torrego propose term actor appropriate characterize class nominal appear mark accusative term animate motivation terminological change
