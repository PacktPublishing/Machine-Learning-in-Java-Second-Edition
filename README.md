**Helpful techniques to design, build, and deploy powerful machine learning applications in Java**

## What is this book about?
As the amount of data continues to grow at an almost incomprehensible rate, being able to understand and process data is becoming a key differentiator for competitive organizations. Machine learning applications are everywhere, from self-driving cars, spam detection, document search, and trading strategies, to speech recognition. This makes machine learning well-suited to the present-day era of Big Data and Data Science. The main challenge is how to transform data into actionable knowledge.

This book covers the following exciting features:
Discover key Java machine learning libraries, what each library brings to the table, and what kind of problems each is able to solve 
Learn how to implement classification, regression, and clustering 
Develop a sustainable strategy for customer retention by predicting likely churn candidates 
Build a scalable recommendation engine with Apache Mahout 
Apply machine learning to fraud, anomaly, and outlier detection 
Experiment with deep learning concepts, algorithms, and the toolbox for deep learning 
Write your own activity recognition model for eHealth applications using mobile sensors

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
data.defineSingleOutputOthersInput(outputColumn); 

EncogModel model = new EncogModel(data); 
model.selectMethod(data, MLMethodFactory.TYPE_FEEDFORWARD);
model.setReport(new ConsoleStatusReportable()); 
data.normalize(); 
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you want to learn how to use Java's machine learning libraries to gain insight from your data, this book is for you. It will get you up and running quickly and provide you with the skills you need to successfully create, customize, and deploy machine learning applications with ease. You should be familiar with Java programming and some basic data mining concepts to make the most of this book, but no prior experience with machine learning is required.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).
### Software and Hardware List
